        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Prague is the capital and largest city in the Czech Republic, the 14th largest city in the European Union and also the historical capital of Bohemia.</p>
        <p>It is known as the <span>city of 100 Spires</span> because of its beautiful cathedrals and their pointy spires.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Visa Requirements</h2>
        <p>Since the Czech Republic falls under the EU, a <a href="https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/">Schengen Visa</a> is required to travel to Prague.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Currency of Prague</h2>
        <p>The currency in Prague is the <a href="http://www.myczechrepublic.com/basics/czech_currency.html">Czech Koruna (CZK)</a>. 25 CZK is equalto 1 Euro (Approximately, for your conveinence). Make sure to carry enough CZK in Prague, since most of the shopkeepers, resturants and other sightseeing attractions accept only Koruna. You can even get other currency exchanged in Prague for Koruna.</p>
        <p>There is a <span>genuine exchange center</span> adjacent to the <span>Palladium Mall</span> (Located just about 15-minute walk from the Old Town Square) in Prague which gives the best rate possible.</p>
        <p><span>DO NOT</span> exchange currency at exchange centers which charge an exorbitant commission.</p>
        <p>If you are not carrying enough Koruna, <span>ATM is the best way to withdraw local currency</span>.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Languages Spoken in Prague</h2>
        <p>The official language of the Czech Republic is Czech, which is spoken by over 96% of its inhabitants. But don't worry, you should have no problem in communicating in English in Prague, and to a lesser extent in German. Older people often speak Russian and German.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Best Time to Visit Prague</h2>
        <p>There are different seasons in Prague just like any other place in the world. We shall discuss each one and you can decide when do you want to visit this beautiful city.</p>
        <p><span>Spring (April - Early June)</span> - Days are <span>longer</span>, accomodations are cheaper, there are fewer tourists and the weather is <span>pleasant to cool</span>.</p>
        <p><span>Summer (Late June - August)</span> - Most people visit <a href="https://travelogueconnect.com/category/destinations/europe/">Europe</a> during this time. But mind it, everything will be <span>expensive in Europe if you travel during the peak season</span>.</p>

        <h2>Getting around Prague - Public Transport</h2>
        <p>You can easily get around Prague by walking or by using the public transport. If you plan to stay for 2-3 days, we suggest you get a <span>day pass for</span> <a href="http://www.myczechrepublic.com/prague/transportation.html">public transport</a> made. It saves money and is easy to use.</p>
        <p>Make sure to <span>validate</span> your day pass or one-time ticket as soon as you get onboard in the <span>yellow vending machine</span> to avoid heavy fines. Just put your ticket in, there is an arrow on the ticket showing how to do it. It will print time and date on it.</p>
        <p><span>Remember:</span> The day pass should be validated only once, in the beginning when you start your journey. The one-time ticket should be validated each time you buy a new ticket. <span>DO NOT</span> validate your day pass or one-time ticket <span>twice</span>. It would be considered as invalid and would attract a hefty fine.</p>

        <h2>Shopping in Prague</h2>
        <h3>Shopping in the Wenceslas Square</h3>
        <p>The main Prague shopping areas are <span>Wenceslas Square</span> and <span>Republic Square</span> , where local shops compete with international department stores. The best way to approach this area is to take a picture in the main street and meander away along the side streets, get lost on purpose and you will discover <span>local shops that sell everything at cheap rates</span> starting from cameras, candies, shoes, souvenirs, clothes and so on. Make sure you enter the buildings around the area because they are dotted with small shops. From the main street, and if you have the time, wander off about five minutes out in all directions then you will discover the secret stores around Wenceslas Square.</p>

        <h3>Coffee at Grand Café Orient</h3>
        <p>It is a <a href="https://grandcafeorient.cz/en/">historic cafe</a>, halfway between the Old Town Square and the Powder Tower, which seems in a time warp as nothing has changed since it was built well over 100 years ago.

        <h3>Beer</h3>
        <p><span>Fun Fact:</span> Did you know that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_in_the_Czech_Republic">Czech Republic has the highest beer consumption per capita in the world</a><span>?!</span> The biggest brands are Pilsner, Budweiser, Gambrinus, Staropramen, Kozel, Bernard, Starobrno, Svijany (and surely some more). And you can get a <span>pint of beer for as cheap as 25 CZK (1 Euro)</span>! So, what are you waiting for? Go, splurge on those beers at a local brewery.</p>
        <p><span>Secret:</span> Deepak used to have an average of 5 beers a day during our trip, and he didn’t gain an inch/kg after our trip! How?? The answer is we used to walk for 10-11 hours daily. So, no extra calories gained. 🙂</p>
